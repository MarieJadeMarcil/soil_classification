### **To Launch the Web App**

#### **Linux/Mac Users**:

1. **Rename the Script (If Necessary)**:
   - If the script file is incorrectly named as `lauch_app.sh`, rename it to `launch_app.sh` by running:
     ```sh
     mv lauch_app.sh launch_app.sh
     ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - Run the following command to give executable permissions to the script:
     ```sh
     chmod +x launch_app.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - To install dependencies and launch the web application, execute the script:
     ```sh
     ./launch_app.sh
     ```

This will automatically install all required dependencies and start the web application.

#### **Windows Users**:

- Simply double-click on `launch_app.bat` or run it via the command prompt:
  ```sh
  launch_app.bat
